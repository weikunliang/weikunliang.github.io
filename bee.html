                		In Spring 2015, I worked on an independent study where our goal was to design a game called “Meaning Bee”. Our goal for that semester was to design the rules and the interface for the game.
                		<br><br>
                		<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

                		Create a “meaning-bee,” where participants are tested on the meanings of words instead of their spellings. The meaning bee would be centered around word senses, which are defined as one line in the dictionary. Players would be shown a word and try to generate as many correct word senses as possible. In this way, players would be encouraged to know a diversity of word senses for each word, to demonstrate mastery of the word’s meaning. The goal is not to have players memorize definitions from the dictionary, but rather to represent a word’s meaning in a thorough and utilitarian manner.

                		<br><br>

                		<h3>Literature Research</h3>

                		We began with a literature survey and researched similar games or competitions that already existed. We took a more in-depth look into the spelling bee and geography bee in particular, to get a sense of the format and flow of these kinds of competitions. Several scenarios were generated as potential formats, applications, and environments for the meaning bee game.

						The format our meaning bee game will mostly be similar to that of the spelling bee and the geography bee in that participants will be asked questions and they will provide answers to the question. The main aspect that is different is the format that answers will be given. In the geography bee, answers are given orally and most of the time, the judge provides options for the participants. In addition, in many games similar to the meaning bee, participants are often given a word and several definitions to chose from, or a definition and several words to chose from. The way our meaning bee distinguishes itself from all similar existing games is that choices are not given. The participant will have to write the answer from scratch. We believe that this way, participants will learn more from the game. In addition, future work of this game can include ways of giving participants more points if they write a more explanatory definition.
						<br><br>
						<h3>Experiment</h3>

						As an experiment, we ran a pilot study to see people’s reactions towards the game and what kind of definitions we got. We tested our idea on a total of 11 people, in small groups of 2-3 people. 

						Our goal of the experiment was to see if the game makes sense and if people can play it and enjoy it. 

						This first prototype of the game took the form of a powerpoint slideshow. In the experiment, we acted as the moderator and flipped through the slides according to the following procedure. 
						<br><br>

                		<h3>Wireframes</h3>

                		From there, we began to visualize the interface of the game through some initial wireframing. We created the wireframes for the single player mode, cooperative mode, and competitive mode, but eventually decided to stick with a simple simple player mode of the game to start with.
                		<img src="assets/images/meaningbee/wireframe.png">
                		<br><br>

                		<h3>Design Decisions</h3>

						After finalizing the wireframes, we went through several iterations of the interface design. We mainly focused on designing the interface for the judging process and the accounts page. Initially, for the judging page, we displayed each definition and had people mark it as “correct” or “incorrect”. After discussing with Anthony and Alex, we decided to create buckets for people to drag definitions to, so that we can find out how people phrase the same definition differently. Our buckets included each correct definition, “incorrect”, “unsure”, and “correct definition but not in list”. Our next iteration mainly focused on the user interaction when the user drags and drops the definition. Our first version of the dragging and dropping interaction included dragging the user’s definition on top of the correct definition, removing the user’s definition, and adding a “1” next to the correct definition. This allows the user to click the “1” beside the list of correct definitions and see which definition was dragged there. However, after some discussion, we felt that we should simplify the design to make the interaction more intuitive. We came up with several alternatives, including just matching the definitions with arrows and having boxes for each definition and dragging it into the boxes. In the end, we decided to use arrows to match the definitions and rearranging it based on position so the arrows look cleaner. 
						<br><br>
						Another main design that we added is the objections page, where the user can object to the judging result if the user thinks that the results were unfair. We included an objection button beside each of the result and also a list of pending and processed objections in the accounts page.
